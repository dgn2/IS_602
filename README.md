This github repository contains the Jupyter notebook file documenting my project, in addition to the HDF5 project data files. 

The project includes code to:

* Extract the historical iShares S&P500 holdings files

* Create and load the historical iShares holdings to a MySQL database

* conduct limited exploratory analysis of the data

* conduct limited cleaning of the data used in subsequent statiscal modeling

* estimate statistical factors based on the price returns of a select portion of the S&P500 universe

* compute sensitivities and do historical back-testing
